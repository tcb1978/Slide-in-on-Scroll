    <p>He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly,
      sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this
      little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? I beg your pardon,
      sir, but do you know what he's talking about? Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond
      the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play
      back the whole thing.</p>
    <p>Are they away? They have just made the jump into hyperspace. You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?
      I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.</p>
    <p>Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're
      who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? Come
      on!
    </p>
    <p>Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here!
      Get away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! Put that thing away!
      You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us
      down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's
      worst. There's something alive in here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see
      that? What? Help!</p>
    <p>Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another
      drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.</p>
